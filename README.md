## RESTful APIs

To support so-called RESTful APIs, you need to support the use of HTTP verbs and attach those verbs to different routes. Different verbs have different meanings. Respect the meanings of the HTTP verbs.

| HTTP verb | Description                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| GET       | Returns data                       |
| POST      | Sends data that creates a resource |
| PUT       | Sends data that updates a resource |
| DELETE    | Removes a resource                 |
